# Xkcd
This python script downloads all xkcd comics and saves it in C:/xkcd in your pc :)
Make sure: 

	0. You have a working internet connection
	1. python is installed
	2. There should be no pre-existing folder called 'xkcd' in your C root directory. 


Click on 'First.bat', close after the dependencies are installed (ignore if already installed)
Click on 'Second.bat', it'll do the rest :)
Have fun.
